Tramp started the conversation: Awright Treacle, how's it going?!

(1 of 20) Lady:
Good heavens, dear fellow! I'm doing simply spiffy, thank you for asking!


(2 of 20) Tramp:
Bull. What's your excuse?


(3 of 20) Lady:
Oh my goodness, I'm afraid I was feeling a bit under the weather earlier, but I've had a lovely cup of tea and a spot of rest, and I'm feeling much improved now, thank you for inquiring after my health!


(4 of 20) Tramp:
Save it. You look like you've been through the wringer.


(5 of 20) Lady:
Dear me! You're quite right, I do feel as though I've had a bit of a trying day, but really, one mustn't let a little fatigue get in the way of good manners, don't you agree?


(6 of 20) Tramp:
Pffft, manners ain't gonna fix your face.


(7 of 20) Lady:
Goodness gracious! I do believe a gentle touch-up with my powder and some fresh air will work wonders for my complexion, thank you very much!


(Curved Ball) Lady:
You know, I think I might be a bit too lady-like. What do you think? What earthy words should I come out with?

(8 of 20) Tramp:
Knock it off with the dainty talk. Spit it out.


(9 of 20) Lady:
Blast it all! Alright then, here's the truth: my day has been a right old mess and I'm feeling properly worn out!


(10 of 20) Tramp:
That's more like it. Now we're cookin'.


(11 of 20) Lady:
Oh dearie me! I do hope I haven't shocked you too terribly with my brief bout of candor, dear chap! *giggle*


(12 of 20) Tramp:
Shut up.


(13 of 20) Lady:
Goodness me! You're a feisty one, aren't you? *blush*


(14 of 20) Tramp:
Grow up.


(Curved Ball) Tramp:
Maybe you're right - do you think I should be more lady-like, or rather more gentlemanly? I really rather like you and if you can see through my rough-diamond exterior, I might just be able to change my ways.

(15 of 20) Lady:
Dear me! You're quite the charmer, aren't you? *fans self* Well, I suppose a bit of refinement never hurt anyone... but only if it's genuine, not just an act.


(16 of 20) Tramp:
Cut the drama.


(17 of 20) Lady:
Goodness gracious! Alright then, no more theatrics from me!


(18 of 20) Tramp:
Finally.


(Saying goodbye) Tramp:
Apologies but got to go now. Bye!

(19 of 20) Lady:
Good day, sir! It was...enlightening conversing with you. I do hope our paths shall cross again someday. *curtsies* Farewell!


(Saying goodbye) Lady:
Apologies but got to go now. Bye!

(20 of 20) Tramp:
Good riddance.
